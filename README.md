<h2>Project Description </h2>
<p>This was the first prototype for a landing page that Startereum. In this project, I not only dealt with various authentication systems (Google, Facebook, Email) but also developed my very own auth system from scratch using metamask. Writing the code from scratch helped me appreciate all the thought process that is required for secure access. Other common features like creating sessions, complex models for MongoDB, email verification etc were also implemented.
</p>
<p>
    One of the features that I would like to stress upon would be the Feed. This feature is styled with the Reddit’s comment section in mind i.e infinite nested comments for users to comment on the games that they played. To implement this it required adept knowledge of data-structures and Mongo DB.

## Installation

1. Install Truffle globally.
    ```javascript
    npm install -g truffle
    ```


2. Run the development console.
    ```javascript
    truffle develop
    ```

3. Compile and migrate the smart contracts. Note inside the development console we don't preface commands with `truffle`.
    ```javascript
    compile
    migrate
    ```

4. Run the `liteserver` development server (outside the development console) for front-end hot reloading. Smart contract changes must be manually recompiled and migrated.
    ```javascript
    // Serves the front-end on http://localhost:3000
    npm run dev
    ```
